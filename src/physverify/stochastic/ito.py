"""Exact properties of iterated Ito integrals, for codes that generate them for Milstein or order 1.5 schemes.

From Ito calculus (Kloeden and Platen, Numerical Solution of SDEs, ch. 5), on a step h with W = W(h):
I_ii = (W_i^2 - h)/2; I_ij + I_ji = W_i W_j for i != j; I_iii = (W_i^3 - 3 h W_i)/6; and by the Ito isometry
E[I_ij^2] = h^2/2, E[I_ijk^2] = h^3/6 for every index choice.

Generators with several noises use a truncated series, so an identity may hold only as the series grows: a truncation
error falls with the series length and a wrong formula does not. In the corpus session of 2026-11-06 one generator had
an I_111 residual of 0.079 and 0.081 RMS at series lengths 10 and 20, and E[I_ijk^2] from 0.116 to 0.206 instead of 1/6.
False alarms on correct integrals are measured in tests/test_new_checks_2026_11.py and stated in docs/checks/numerical-controls.md.
