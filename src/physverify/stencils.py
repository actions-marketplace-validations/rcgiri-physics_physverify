"""Finite-difference stencils: consistency and order from the weights alone (no grid, no solver).

A stencil for the d-th derivative, sum_k w_k f(x + k h) / h^d, has Taylor moments m_n = sum_k w_k k^n / n!.
It is consistent when m_n = 0 for n < d and m_d = 1, and its order of accuracy is p when the first nonzero
moment after m_d is m_{d+p} (LeVeque, Finite Difference Methods for ODEs and PDEs, sec. 1.5; Fornberg 1988).
In the 2026-10 corpus sessions four repositories had FD tables to check this way, and one "8th-order" table
had order 6.
