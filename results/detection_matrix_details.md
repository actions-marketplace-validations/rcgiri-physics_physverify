### sod / gamma_wrong
- reference [Sod shock tube, density L1] FAIL: error does not decrease with resolution (about 0.0605 at the finest level); the error is the same at every resolution, which points to something independent of the step (a jump in the model such as a potential cutoff crossing, a wrong constant, or a reference for a different problem) rather than to the integrator
- reference [smooth density wave, periodic] PASS: observed order 0.98 (expected 1)
- invariant [discrete conservation of mass, momentum, energy] FAIL: expected an exact solution to round-off, but the error reaches 0.03 and shrinks at about order -0.00

### sod / nonconservative_momentum
- reference [Sod shock tube, density L1] PASS: observed order 0.43 (expected 0.5)
- reference [smooth density wave, periodic] PASS: observed order 0.98 (expected 1)
- invariant [discrete conservation of mass, momentum, energy] FAIL: expected an exact solution to round-off, but the error reaches 0.0113 and shrinks at about order 0.80

### sod / wave_speed_without_sound
- reference [Sod shock tube, density L1] PASS: observed order 0.59 (expected 0.5)
- reference [smooth density wave, periodic] PASS: observed order 0.99 (expected 1)
- invariant [discrete conservation of mass, momentum, energy] EXACT: reproduced to round-off (largest error 4.4e-16), as designed

### sod / last_step_not_clipped
- reference [Sod shock tube, density L1] PASS: observed order 0.63 (expected 0.5)
- reference [smooth density wave, periodic] PASS: observed order 0.98 (expected 1)
- invariant [discrete conservation of mass, momentum, energy] FAIL: expected an exact solution to round-off, but the error reaches 0.00208 and shrinks at about order 1.33

### sod / reflective_boundary
- reference [Sod shock tube, density L1] PASS: observed order 0.63 (expected 0.5)
- reference [smooth density wave, periodic] PASS: observed order 0.98 (expected 1)
- invariant [discrete conservation of mass, momentum, energy] EXACT: reproduced to round-off (largest error 4.4e-16), as designed
